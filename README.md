This is the **next** version on Wilderness, built on top of
[Wilderness core](https://github.com/colinmeinke/wilderness-core).

It's pretty much there. Remaining tasks before it is released:

- Timeline events
- ~~Testing the DOM libraries~~
- ~~Adding code comments to the DOM libraries~~
- Creating documentation

If you'd like to give it a spin right now, download this repo and run:

```
yarn install
yarn build
```

This will build three directories:

- `cjs` for commonjs use
- `modules` for es2015 module use
- `dist` for umd use

For the current (relatively) stable version please use
[version v4.1.1](https://github.com/colinmeinke/wilderness/tree/v4.1.1).
